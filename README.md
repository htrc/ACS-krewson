# Phase 2: Bounding Boxes for Illustrated Regions

Test script is bounding_boxes.py in the top level of the repo.

The weights file is located in the shared project folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/192kQjpaVvOmiaJMOUNnJMZX2Q4PDNGUa

It should be placed in a subfolder named 'weights', like so:

weights/mask_rcnn_bbox_weights.h5

N.B. I need to figure out the dependencies for this phase of the project other than numpy and tensorflow.
